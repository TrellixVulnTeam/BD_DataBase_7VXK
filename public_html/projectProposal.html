    Clients can login to our system with a username and password, which are both encrypted in the database. The login form has a checkbox option to “Remember me today.” If this option is checked upon a successful login, the website will remember them for a 24-hour period (without requiring login if they leave and return to the site later). If not checked, the site will only remember them for a 1-hour period.
    To provide added security, we will block out an account after 5 unsuccessful login attempts, after which the user must reset their password by following a link that is emailed to the address stored in the database for the given username.
    Clients are able to purchase imaginary stocks with a set of credits given to them when they make their account, stocks will be “bought and sold” by the website to give the users a sense of imaginary trading (essentially paper trading) the website will list the top 10 traders accounts
