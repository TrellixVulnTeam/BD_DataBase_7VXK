        <h1>Intro:<br></h1>
        
        <p>
            Our vision is to create a platform for users to gather data and financially analyze their perspective investments with other investors on a social platform. 
            Users will have access to historical and real-time stock data visualization as well as the ability to overlay quantitative indicators such as MACD which will
            help them determine when to buy / sell more effectively. Once users have sign up for an account, they can add stocks to their portfolio and paper trade to track
            potential profit / loss on risky investments, or track their own portfolios all in one convenient place. Each stock will have relational data such 
            "bullish" and "bearish" user rating as well as comments. Additionally, there will be a forum space where users can have general conversation about trading strategies
            and investment opportunities in market fluctuations.
        </p>


        <h1>Features:<br></h1>

        <p>
            <br>1. Clients can login to our system with a username and password, which are both encrypted in the database. The login form has a checkbox option to “Remember me today.” If this option is checked upon a successful login, the website will remember them for a 24-hour period (without requiring login if they leave and return to the site later). If not checked, the site will only remember them for a 1-hour period.
            <br>2. To provide added security, we will block out an account after 5 unsuccessful login attempts, after which the user must reset their password by following a link that is emailed to the address stored in the database for the given username.

Clients are able to purchase imaginary stocks with a set of credits given to them when they make their account, stocks will be “bought and sold” by the website to give the users a sense of imaginary trading (essentially paper trading) the website will list the top 10 traders accounts
